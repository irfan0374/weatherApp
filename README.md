Features:
**OpenWeatherMap API Integration**: Fetches real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and description.
Mapbox Integration: Utilizes **Mapbox** to obtain the user's precise location, ensuring accurate weather forecasts.
Error Handling: Employs **Toastify** to display notifications in case of incorrect location input or when weather data is unavailable.
User-friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive user interface for seamless weather browsing experience.
